# 👋 Hi, I'm Gaurang Ambasana

**I've been playing/writing/reviewing/criticizing 💻 computer code for ~ 5 years as a primary profession. I'm pretty good at using TypeScript, React ⚛️, JavaScript (you know, the usual), Python 🐍 and Node.js (a bit of GraphQL thrown in). When I say "clean code," I mean I write code that's easy to read and understand, like organizing your tools neatly. I enjoy solving challenges like fun puzzles and am super excited to work together to create cool things in the tech world! 🚀🐎**

**Never forget that the code is just a tool, the goal is to use Full Stack Technologies to solve real-world problems.🛠️**

### 🧑‍💻 About Me

I love shipping products that are **fast**, **responsive**, and **maintainable**.

- 🛠️ **Frontend:** TypeScript, React, Next.js, Zustand, Redux
- ⚙️ **Backend:** Node.js, FastAPI, GraphQL
- ☁️ **Cloud & Tools:** AWS, Docker, Auth0, Google Workspace  
- 🗃️ **Data:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, BigQuery

I care deeply about **clean code**, **strong code reviews**, and **collaboration** — whether it's polishing a pixel-perfect UI or optimizing backend services for performance.
